# Foodgram-bot

Our miracle top-bot will help you with advice and a recipe when you have nothing but eggs, 
milk and sausages in the fridge, a deadline for mathematical analysys and fatigue after university classes. 
Just give a command to our bot and it will offer you delicious dishes based on what is in your fridge right now! 
Welcome! Foodgram is glad to see you! :)
